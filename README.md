# Hubrick DevOps Challenge

Your objective is to create a [Chef] cookbook that provisions and configures an Ubuntu instance, running nginx that serves a plain html hello world file on port 80.

For setting up the cookbook structure and handling the chef dependencies use [Berkshelf]. Local provisioning and testing shall be handled with [Test Kitchen] â€“ you can use either the default [Vagrant] driver or [Docker] driver for this. Provide at least one spec using [InSpec] that ensures the correct setup of the instance.

## Deliverables

You should provide us with a github repository containing the cookbook. The instance shall be provisioned with the command:
```
$ kitchen converge
```
Tests should be run with:
```
$ kitchen verify
```

### Bonus points

* Use the [EC2] driver instead of Vagrant/Docker to provision an AWS instance.
* Integrate [travis-ci] in your solution's repository to run the tests automatically.
